1. START
2. Declare class with name EqMat
3. Declare two dimensional array int a[][] and int m,n;
4. Declare a parameterised constructor taking arguments mm and nn and inside set values of m=mm and n=nn;
5. Declare a readArray method to accept elements of the array by running two for loops as int i=0;i<m;i++ and inside int j=0;j<n;j++
6.Declare a check method to accept two objects of EqMat class check if two arrays are equal or not by running loops as int i=0;i<m;i++ and inside int j=0;j<n;j++ and inside checking if P.
7. Declare a print method to print the array by running two for loops as int i=0;i<m;i++ and inside int j=0;j<n;j++
8. Inside main method take user input for rows and columns and initialise two objects of  EqMat class and pass rows and columns as parameters while creating them
9. class readArray and print method for both the objects and finally call check method to determine if the two matrix are equal or not
10. End
