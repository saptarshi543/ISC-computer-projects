1. START
2. Declare a class Plane
	i) Initialize integer values as x1,y1.
	ii) Declare a parameterised constructor taking int x, int y as parameters.
	iii) Set x1=x and y1=y.
	iv) Declare a method show to print the values of x1 and x2

3. Declare a class Circle which extends Plane
	A)
		i) Initialize integer values as x2,y2.
		ii) Declare a parameterised constructor taking int a, int b, int c, int d as parameters.
		iii) Call the super class's constructor as super(a,b).
		iv) Set x2=c, y2=d.
	B) Declare a method named findRadius.
		Set radius as (Math.sqrt( ( Math.pow((x2-x1),2) + Math.pow( (y2-y1), 2) )  )) /2.
	C) Declare a method named findArea.
		Set area as ((22/7)*(Math.pow(radius,2))).
	D) Declare a method as show.
		Print the coordinates of both classes along wih the radius and area.
	E) Declare a main method.
		i) Take input from user for the four co-ordinates.
		ii) Initialize a object of class Circle.
		iii) Call findRadius, findArea, show
