1. START
2. Declare a class named Series
3. Declare a method as factorial taking a int variable "a" as parameter.
4. Inside initialize int f=1. Run a for loop as for(int i=1;i<=a;i++)
5. Inside the loop update f as f*=i;
6. Declare a method as Series1 taking (int x, int n) as parameter.
7. Inside set int sum=0, and run a for loop as for(int i=2;i<=n;i++).
8. Inside the loop, update sum as sum+=((Math.pow(x,i))/(S.factorial(i-1))).
9. Declare a method as Series1 taking (int x, int n) as parameter.
10.Inside set int sum=0, and run a for loop as for(int i=2;i<=n;i++).
11.Inside the loop, update sum as sum+=((Math.pow(x,i))/(S.factorial(i-1))).
12.Create a main method and call the methods accordingly.
