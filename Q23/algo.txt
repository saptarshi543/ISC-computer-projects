1. Start 

2. Declare class WordPile 

3. Declare a character array as char ch[]; and declare int top, capacity; 

4. Declare a constructor with parameter int cap to take capacity of the stack and set top=-1, capacity=cap and ch =new char[cap]; 

5. Declare a pushChar method taking char v as argument and inside if stack is not already full, set ch[++top]=v else display  WordPile is full. 

6. Declare a popChar method to remove the topmost element of the stack. Inside if the stack is empty display \\ else set int x=ch[top--]; and return x 

7. Declare a display method to print the stack. 

8. Inside run a loop as for(int i=0;i<=top;i++)  

9. Inside the loop print as ch[i]; 

10. Declare main method and take the capacity of the stack as input. Create an object of class WordPile as W and call W.take_input(); Declare char tmp. 

11.  Inside a while loop take user input according to their choice to either display the stack , add character to the stack, remove the topmost character, or to exit the program using switch case and calling W.pushChar() and W.popChar() and W.display() accordingly. 

12. END
