Caesar Cipher is an encryption technique which is implemented as ROT13 ('rotate by 13 places'). It is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 places after it in the alphabets, with the other characters remaining unchanged.


Write a program to accept a plain text of length L, where L must be greater than 3 and less than 100.

Encrypt the text if valid as per the Caesar Cipher.

Test your program with the sample data and some random data.

Example 1

INPUT:
Hello! How are you?

OUTPUT:
The cipher text is:
Uryyb! Ubj ner lbh?

Example 2

INPUT:
Encryption helps to secure data.

OUTPUT:
The cipher text is:
Rapelcgvba urycf gb frpher qngn.

Example 3

INPUT:
You

OUTPUT:
INVALID LENGTH
