This is a repo where all my ISC class 11 computer projects are stored.

Every folder is for one question only. Every folder has a algo.txt where
the algorithm is written and the source code. The question is written inside
comments in the top of the source code.

**ALSO AT THE TIME OF WRITING THIS MD FILE
GITHUB DOES NOT HANDLE .jpg FILES VERY WELL AT ALL
HENCE I CREATED AN ISSUE WHERE ALL THE OUTPUT SCREENSHOTS 
OF ALL THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED ALONG WITH THEIR QUESTION NO.

sorry for the inconvenience 
**

all the questions along with the algorithm , source code variable description 
table and output screenshots are available in one place in the 
"ISC-class_11ComputerProjects.docx" word file

and our stupid council for education has made it compulsory to do all
the programs in blue j so some of the programs are missing "String args[]" ,etc, etc 
and if you try to run all of them natively or someplace else you will notice some of them are broken
