1. START 
2. Declare a class named Number
	a) Declare a int named n.
	b) Declare a parameterised constructor and assign n=x.
	c) Declare a int method named factorial taking a int as argument.
	d) Inside set int f=1.
	e) Run a loop from i=1 to argument. Inside update f as f*=i.
	f) Declare a void method named display and display the value of n.

3. Declare a class named Series which extends Number
	a) Declare a parameterised constructor and call superclass's constructor.
	b) Declare a void method named calSum. 
	c) Run a loop from i=1 to n and inside update sum+=factorial(i).
	d)Declare a void method named display and call superclass's display method and  print the sum

4. Declare a main method and Initialize an object and call methods accordingly
