A superclass Number is defined to calculate the factorial of a number. Define a subclass Series to find the sum of the series S = 1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + ………. + n!.

The details of the members of both classes are given below:
Class name: Number
Data member/instance variable:
n: to store an integer number
Member functions/methods:
Number(): constructor to initialize the data member
int factorial(int a): returns the factorial of a number
(factorial of n = 1 × 2 × 3 × …… × n)
void display() : display the member variable
Class name: Series
Data member/instance variable:
sum: to store the sum of the series
Member functions/methods:
Series(…) : parameterized constructor to initialize the data members of both the classes
void calSum(): calculates the sum of the given series
void display(): displays the data members of both the classes
Using the concept of inheritance, specify both the classes giving the details of the constructor (…), void caSum(), and void display(). Also define the main method.
