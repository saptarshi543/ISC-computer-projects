1. START
2. Declare class with name Happy
3. Declare a default constructor setting value of n=0
4. Declare a getnum method to set value of n to the value the user enters
5. Declare a sum_sq_digits method to take x as an argument and find out the sum of square of x
6. Inside sum_sq_digits declare int copy=x and int sum=0
7. Run a While loop as long as copy is greater than 0. assign sum as sum += Math.pow((copy%10), 2) and copy/=10
8. Return sum
9. Declare a isHappy method to check if n is a Happy number or not
10. Inside declare int result=n and run a while loop as long as result!=1 and result!=4
11. Inside assign result=sum_sq_digits(result)
12. Outside the while loop, check if result is 1 or not. If result is 1 , print n is a happy number else print n is not a happy number
13. Declare a main method to take input from user. 
14. Create a object of Happy class and call getnum method and pass user input as argument ,and call isHappy method
15. END
