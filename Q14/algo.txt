1. START
2. Declare a class named Disarium and initialize variables int num,size.
3. Declare a parameterised constructor taking int n as argument and inside set num=n  and size=0.
4. Declare a method countDigits and inside initialize variables as  int copy=num,count=0.
5. Run a while loop as long as copy is greater than 0 and post increment count. Outside the loop set size = count.
6. Declare a method SumOfDigits taking arguments as int n,int p.
7. Check if n is 0 then return 0 else return (int)(Math.pow(n%10,p))+SumOfDigits(n/10,p-1).
8. Declare a main method and take user input.
9. Initialize a object of class Disarium and call countDigits and check methods.
10. END
