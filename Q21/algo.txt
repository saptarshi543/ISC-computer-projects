1. START

2. Declare a class named ISBN

3. Declare a method named isValid returning boolean value

4. Inside check if length of the isbn provided by the user is 10 or not
	if not 10, return false.

5. If length is 10, initialize int sum=0, count=10, boolean contains_x=false, int digit.

6. Check if the last character is "X" or not and accordingly update value of
contains_x.

7. Run a for loop as for(int i=0; i<=9 ;i++). Check if the loop is on its last iteration. If true, then set digit as 10, else set digit as s.charAt(i)-'0'. Update sum as sum +=(count-- * digit).

8. Check if the sum is divisible by 11 or not and accordingly return a boolean v	alue.

9. Declare a main method.

10. Take user input in the form of string 

11.Initialize boolean ans=O.isValid(String.valueOf(user))

12.Print "VALID" or "INVALID" according isValid method
