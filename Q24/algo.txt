1. START
2. Declare a class named Queue.
	a) Initialize integer variables MAX, size, front, rear.
	Note that variable MAX is a constant.

	b) Initialize an intger array named que.
	
	c) Delare a parametrised constructor and inside declare size,que, and set front and rear both to 0.
	
	d) Declare a method named addele with parameter int v. Inside check if rear<(size-1).
		i) If true, set que[rear]=v, update rear as rear++, print that the element has been added to the queue.
		ii) Else, print "Queue overflow".
	
	e) Declare a method named delele and check if front is equal to rear.
		i) If true, return -9999.
		ii) Else, return que[front++].

	f) Declare a method named show. Check if front is equal to rear.
		i) If true, print "Empty"
		ii) Else, run a loop from rear to front, decrementing the variable. Inside print que[i].

3. Declare a main method and inside declare variable s=100. Call the methods accordingly.
