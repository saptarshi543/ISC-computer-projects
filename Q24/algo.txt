1. START
2. Declare a class named Queue.
	a) Initialize integer variables size, front, rear.
	b) Initialize an intger array named que.
	c) Delare a parametrised constructor and inside check if the size is greater than 100, if not declare size,que, and set front and rear both to 0, else exit showing "Out of range!".
	
	d) Declare a method named addele with parameter int v. Inside check if rear<(size-1).
		i) If true, set que[rear]=v, update rear as rear++, print that the element has been added to the queue.
		ii) Else, print "Queue overflow".
	
	e) Declare a method named delele and check if front is equal to rear.
		i) If true, return -9999.

		ii) a) Initialize and declare int removed = que[front].
			b) Run a loop through 0 to rear-1, inside setting que[i]=que[i+1].
			c) Decrement rear.
			d) return removed.

	f) Declare a method named show. Check if front is equal to rear.
		i) If true, print "Empty"
		ii) Else, run a loop from front to rear-1, incrementing the variable. Inside print que[i].

3. Declare a main method and inside declare variable s=100. Call the methods accordingly.
