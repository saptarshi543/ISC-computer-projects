1. START
2. Declare a class named MaxMin
3. Declare a two dimension array as int arr[][] and initialise int M,N
4. Declare a parameterised constructor to take the rows and columns and inside set M=m; N=n and set arr=new int[m][n]
5. Declare a method readArray to take input for the array.
6. Run a loop as for(int i=0;i<M;i++) and inside for(int j=0;i<N;j++)
7. Inside take input as arr[i][j]=nrt.nextInt()
8. Declare a method display to print the array by running a loop as in LINE 6
9. Declare a method findMaxMin and inside initialise int maxR=arr[0][0],minR=arr[0][0],maxC=arr[0][0],minC=arr[0][0]. Start a try block and inside run a loop as in LINE 6, and inside set maxR= Math.max(maxR, arr[i][j]); minR=Math.min(minR, arr[i][j]) and outside print the max and min element of that current row.
